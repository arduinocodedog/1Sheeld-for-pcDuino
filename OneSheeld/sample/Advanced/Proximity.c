Proximity Shield Example

This example shows an application on 1Sheeld's proximity shield.

By using this example, you can campture a picture and
send a SMS when the value of the smartphone's proximity
sensor exceeds a certain limit.

OPTIONAL:
To reduce the library compiled size and limit its memory usage, you
can specify which shields you want to include in your sketch by
defining CUSTOM_SETTINGS and the shields respective INCLUDE_ define.
